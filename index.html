    <h1 align="center">TREES</h1>
    <h1 align="center">by: MARK ONG</h1>

    <p align="center">I<br> think<br> that &nbsp; &nbsp; I<br> Shall never <br> see,&nbsp; &nbsp;A poem
    <br> Lovely&nbsp; as a tree <br> A tree &nbsp;whose hungry <br> mount is priest,&nbsp; Against
     <br> the &nbsp; earth's sweet &nbsp; flowing <br> breast. &nbsp; A tree &nbsp; that &nbsp; looks at <br> God all day, &nbsp; And lifts her
    leaft <br> arms to pray, &nbsp; A tree &nbsp; that may in <br> Summer wear. &nbsp; A nest &nbsp; of robins in
     <br> her &nbsp; &nbsp; hait , upon whose bosom &nbsp; snow <br> has lain, &nbsp; whose intimately live with rain
     <br> poems are make <br> by fools like me, <br> but only God can <br> make &nbsp; a &nbsp; tree.</p>
